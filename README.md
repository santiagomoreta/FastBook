Our Project
--------- 

> Fast-Book.com is a web application designed to facilitate the exchange of textbooks, providing a service increasingly > used as the second hand market, in our case, textbooks, academic, literary, poetic ones and so on.

> What we want with our application is to provide a useful and free service to the community, which is characterized by its simplicity, speed and ease of use, so that Fast-Book automates all typical processes which occur in program exchanges, with the objective o everything being done quickly and easily.

The Idea
--------

> Fast-Book.com is a website in which anyone can give a new life to your used books , the ones you no longer want to keep, selling them to recover some of your initial investment, or simply giving them away as you interchange them with somebody else.

> At the same time, users can search an extensive catalog and buy or exchange the used books they need.

The Goal
--------

> In Fast-Book.com we aim to extend the maximum possible use of our service in the market of second-hand books, throughout the entire country in order to ensure that everyone has access to textbooks you need or you are looking for. That’s why we can guarantee a good price for both the buyer and the seller.

> In addition to an exchange platform of textbooks, Fast-Book.com allows sending notifications and communicating them  via email to users to keep them informed about their future purchases, as well as new books are added to our application.
